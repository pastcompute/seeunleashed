Our web app is called School Environment Explorer.  It is a tool to help young people become familiar with maintaining their environment.

Our team members are Andrew McDonnell, Kylie Willison and Zachary McDonnell.

The purpose of our project is to create a tool for use by young people and teachers.  It encourages recycling, care for and self discovery of the environment and the use of digital tools.

The data sets we have used are from: 

Dept for Education and Child Development
sa.gov.au
Zero Waste SA 


Programming Languages

Hosting


Not all of the data we needed was in useable formats so some of our time was taken up with learning about and trying to convert data formats such as kml.  Also a particulary tricky .pdf document was finally converted to text using an online converter.


The benefit of our project is in its appeal to young people, peer mentoring and the assistance it gives teachers in presenting recycling in a new way, making access to information easier and more useable in the classroom.â€‹
